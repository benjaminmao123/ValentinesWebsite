        <p>Happy Valentine's Day, my love.</p>
        <p>
          I just wanted to take a moment to tell you something that honestly never
          feels like enough words — how grateful I am for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You make my days lighter, my thoughts calmer, and my life infinitely more
          beautiful just by being in it. It's not just the big moments I love, but
          the small ones too — the laughs, the conversations, the quiet comfort of
          simply knowing you're there.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's something incredibly special about the way you exist in my world.
          The way you smile, the way you think, the way you care — all of it feels
          like something I never want to take for granted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for being you.
          <br />
          Thank you for being mine.
          <br />
          Thank you for making my heart feel so full.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter where we are, no matter what we're doing, you will always be my
          favorite person, my favorite feeling, and my favorite place.
        </p>
        <p>Happy Valentine's Day ❤️</p>
